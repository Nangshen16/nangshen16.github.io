    <figcaption>Perched 125 metres above the ground, the one-MICHELIN-starred restaurant Jules Verne opens onto three successive rooms offering a breathtaking view over the Champ-de-Mars, Quai Branly and Trocadéro. Frédéric Anton, awarded Meilleur Ouvrier de France, has just one wish: to run a luxurious Jules Verne with an expert hand offering an unbeatable gastronomic experience.

    <p> The Tower’s lights and sparkles
        The Iron Lady first donned her golden raiment on 31 December 1985, and it was an instant success. The 336 yellow-orange spotlights it encompasses are integrated into the structure itself and serve two purposes: they highlight the Eiffel Tower’s elegant structure and ensure its safe night-time operation.
        
        Previously, the Eiffel Tower was illuminated by many more external projectors. It has always been lit up after dark, by gas lighting before electricity took over.
        
        When are the lights and sparkles turned on?
        The projectors are triggered automatically by nightfall sensors. The sparkling lights are superimposed over the golden lights for 5 minutes at the beginning of each hour until 1 am.
        
        A note to you night owls: the last sparkling lights at 1 am have a special little feature, the golden lights go out and the Tower is left only to sparkles for 10 minutes!</p>
