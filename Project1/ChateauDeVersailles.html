        <p>The glittering Hall of Mirrors is the most famous room of Versailles. Architect Jules Hardouin-Mansart dreamed up a completely new and spectacular look for this dazzling Baroque reception hall, created between 1678 and 1684. Mansart succeeded in achieving an ambience of grandeur that Louis XIV envisioned.
    
            The 73-meter-long hall is lined with 17 massive ornamental mirrors, each in 18 segments. This ensemble of more than 300 mirror segments creates a striking effect. The room sparkles with sunlight entering through the windows and reflecting off the mirrors. Extravagant crystal chandeliers, gilded statues, and marvelous ceiling paintings add to the grandeur.
            <!-- The masterwork of 17th-century landscape designer André Le Nôtre, these orderly gardens are more like a piece of artwork than a scene of nature. Perfectly trimmed shrubbery and tidy lawns are shaped in geometric patterns, characteristic of French formal gardens. -->

        To realize the vision of Louis XIV, architect Louis Le Vau created a refined neoclassical palace, while Jules Hardouin-Mansart later added the sumptuous Galerie des Glaces..The château exemplifies French Classicism and set the standard for royal courts in the 17th century.

        The idyllic natural setting of Versailles provided a beautiful backdrop for the château but it also served another purpose. The government administration and Court of nobles were obliged to relocate from Paris. When courtiers arrived in Versailles, they were on Louis XIV's turf, and the palace's grandiosity reminded them of the king's glory.
        
        Successive monarchs Louis XV and Louis XVI made their mark on the Château de Versailles with elegant Baroque and Rococo decor, as well as gorgeous gardens. The luxurious lifestyle and lavish entertainment that began during the reign of Louis XIV continued. However, the party ended with the French Revolution.
        
        Today, the 2,300-room Château de Versailles is a UNESCO World Heritage Site that offers a window into the opulent lifestyle of France's Ancien Régime. The Domaine of the Château de Versailles covers over 800 hectares; this vast parkland is open to the public. Much of the palace, including the apartments of the King and Queen, may be visited by ticket holders.
        
        You can reach Versailles from Paris by a combination of Métro and train, but a more convenient way is to join a full-day tour to Versailles from Paris that includes direct transportation by bus or minivan.
        
        Note: Some businesses may be temporarily closed due to recent global health and safety issues.
