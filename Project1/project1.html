    <h2>Paris</h2>
    
    <p>Paris is the capital and most popular city of France with an estimated population of 2,165,432 residents. It is also famous for Effiel Tower, Château de Versailles, and Haute Courture.</p>

            <p>The single most famous man-made structure in the entire world, the Eiffel Tower was originally erected as a temporary exhibit for the Exposition Universelle of 1889 (it was due to be taken down in 1909). From its summit you can enjoy heart-stopping views over all of Paris – and conversely its iconic form is visible from most vantage points in the city. Aside from the new glass floor that was installed in 2014 – which is a real trip if you’re brave enough to walk across it –there’s also a panoramic champagne bar on the third floor, a brasserie and a Michelin-starred restaurant</p>

            <p>There are few things grander in fashion than haute couture. With a minuscule client base (approximately 4,000 worldwide) and an exclusive allocation of industry tickets for runway presentations, the practice can seem entirely fanciful and out of reach. In truth, the art of couture is a tightly controlled, invite-only application, governed by Paris’s Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode (FHCM) with widespread influence on the fashion industry at large.


                Founded in 1868, the FHCM preserves the exacting standards of French fashion culture by presiding over Paris women’s and men’s fashion weeks, as well as endorsing and nurturing designers who exhibit a quality of craftsmanship that meets the level required to show on the official haute couture schedule.
                
                
                Vogue speaks to key figures within the organisation—as well as Dior’s artistic director Maria Grazia Chiuri, who was awarded France’s Legion d’honneur this week—about the inner workings of this enigmatic French institution.

                <p>The Château de Versailles can surely now lay claim to the title of the most sumptuous pad in Paris. It’s grown with each resident and now has an astonishing 2,300 rooms that have housed numerous member of the French royalty over the years. The majority of the lavish work was commissioned by Louis XIV in 1678. The Sun King is virtually synonymous with Versailles: he’s responsible for adding the wondrous Hall of Mirrors, as well as the elegant and expansive grounds. It can get busy at peak times, so book a skip-the-line ticket beforehand and arrive early.</p>

       <dt>Why is Paris called the ‘The City of Light’?</dt>
       <dd>Paris is often referred to as ‘The City of Light’, and not just because it was one of the first European cities to install widespread gas-powered lighting. It was also the centre of the European Enlightenment in the mid-18th century – a period that was marked by an explosion of new, revolutionary ideas concerning people’s relationships to the world around them, to God and to the state.</dd>
       <br>
       <dt>Why is Paris the capital of fashion today?</dt>
       <dd>Simply because little has changed, despite the drop in the number of couture houses. The most important fashion shows still take place in Paris and more aspiring designers go to the city to learn and showcase their work than they do London, New York or Milan</dd>
